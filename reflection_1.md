## 2. Tools

### Literature Review

1. There is no shortcut to reading papers — more reading strengthens your story.
2. Use tools as assistants, not substitutes.
3. [Elicit](https://elicit.com/) – useful for literature review.
4. GPT models can still hallucinate — verify everything.

## 3. Visuals

- Use a strong concept figure to demonstrate your problem.
- Clear figures represent ideas better than text alone.

### Tools for Creating Figures

- Illustrator
- 3D World (e.g., [icograms](https://icograms.com/))
- Photoshop
- PowerPoint
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

### Creating a Good Concept Figure

1. First imagine it yourself.
2. Use AI for brainstorming ideas.
3. Polish and recreate it using proper tools.

## 4. Plots and Results

- Keep plots simple but visually appealing.
- Use a good color palette.
- Use tools (e.g., Claude, notebooks) for generating clean plots.
- Choose the right type of plot for the data.

## 5. Final Tips

1. After fixing the title, search Google Scholar to check relevance.
2. Create a paper webpage (Google Sites / GitHub).
3. Ensure all claims are supported by results.
4. Write yourself first → polish with AI → don’t over-invest in the first draft.
5. Don’t use both tables and plots for the same data.
6. Check the relevance of every figure in the paper.
